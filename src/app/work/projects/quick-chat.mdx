summary: "Quick Chat is a real-time chat application build using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN Stack). It means, when we send a message to another user, they will instantly receive the message without re-loading the application. For creating this real-time messaging feature we will use Socket.IO. It is a free and open-source library that enables real-time bi-direction communication between client app and server."
